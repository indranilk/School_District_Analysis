# School_District_Analysis

Overview of Project

In this project we analyzed different reading and math grade scores for students as well as school type, size, and budget. We calculated average scores and overall percentages of students passing each subject, cleaned data, and created a new dataframe with new data.  

Results:
•	All calculations of scores, total students, and passing percentages completed first. 
•	After all calculations are completed, a new dataframe is created. 
•	District summary reformatted with total budget, percentages of passing math, reading, both subjects, and average math and reading scores.

School Summary
•	Average test scores, passing percentages, number of students passing each class, and number of students passing each class by school are all calculated 
•	 New dataframe, school_summary_df is created after all scores are calculated
•	School summary dataframe reformatted with number of students, school type, average reading and math scores, and the percent of overall passing students

•	Replacing student scores for Nan’s for math and reading scores provides less data to calculate for Thomas High School

•	Adding NaN’s reduces reading and math scores as NaN’s were included in the Student_complete dataframe. 

Summary

The changes in the district analysis were in students passing math, student passing reading, average math scores, and average reading scores for Thomas High School 9th graders. As we added Nan’s there was less data to calculate for Thomas High School 9th graders which changed the results a lot. There was less data which caused the numbers to go down significantly.
